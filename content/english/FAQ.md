# What is the purpose of the study?

The aim of this project is to examine people's thoughts, feelings, concerns, and motivations regarding the coronavirus, and factors that migh influence people's responses. We want to understand how people respond to recent developments in society, some of which are a direct consequence of the coronavirus.

# What does the set-up of the study look like?

The study consists of several questionnaires that are sent out every week or every other week. The first questionnaire is the longest (approximately 20 minutes) so we can get an insight in your living situation, normal day-to-day activities, and other variables that may help predict how people deal with the coronavirus and which variables combat the spread of the virus. The follow-up questionnaires focus on how you are responding to changes related to the coronavirus, especially concerning daily activities, concerns, and feelings. 

# How do I participate?

You can participate by clicking on the survey link on the front-page of this website.

# I want to end my participation, how do I do this?

You can stop the survey at any moment by closing your browser window. Answers that you might have already provided will be deleted from the dataset. 

# How is my data stored?

The data from this study will be stored in a secure location in the Department of Psychology at the University subject to the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (GDPR) and the American Psychological Association. If you want to have full details on this process please have a look at how we [manage your data](https://psycorona.org/data/).

# How is my sensitive data stored?

Only two people have access to your e-mail and your ZIP code (if you decide to provide them in the first place). If you are interested in knowing how we make sure that your data is secure please have a look at the [data management](https://psycorona.org/data/). 

# Who has access to my data?

Your completely anonymized responses can be shared with researchers at universities subject to the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (GDPR) and the American Psychological Association. There is a whole process specified [here](https://psycorona.org/data/) that ensures that as little as possible data is shared and that you as an individual can never be identified in the shared dataset.

# Why am I asked to provide my e-mail address?

We will ask you for your email so that we can invite you to participate in follow-up weekly surveys. This can help us to understand how your responses may change over time when dealing with the coronavirus.That being said, providing your e-mail adress does not obligate you to respond to the questionnaires on a weeky basis. The more data you provide, the better our knowledge base will be. Your contact information will remain confidential and we will not share it with third parties. After the research is completed, your email will be deleted from our data. This ensures that we cannot connect your actual survey responses to any of your personal information.

# Why am I asked to provide my ZIP code?

ZIP code information allows us to combine responses from multiple people in a given region. This helps us to get a more general idea of what people are thinking and feeling in that region, and to compare responses from individuals in different regions. Your ZIP code will also be matched to local virus spread information. This may give us an insight whether there are specific psychological variables that combat the spread of the virus (e.g. why are some people more willing to stay at home). After the research is completed, your ZIP code information will be deleted from our data. This ensures that we cannot connect your actual survey responses to any of your personal information.

# Will you ask for personal information?

The survey asks respondents to indicate their gender, general age range, and general religious and political philosophies. Like all questions in the survey, these questions are optional.

# Why are there questions about religious beliefs?

Some people believe that spiritual deities are guides, others believe that dieties control events in their lives. This may affect people's sense of safety and thus their pandemic behavior. 

# Why are there question about political opinions?

Many countries show sharp partisan divides in beliefs about the pandemic. This may affect people's sense of safety and thus their pandemic behavior.
