title: About This Study
---

Psychology and culture could affect the spread of the virus; human psychology could also change in response to the pandemic. We aim to mobilize behavioral and data scientists to identify targets for rapid intervention to slow the spread of the pandemic and minimize its social damage. All the scientists on the team are operating on a largely volunteer basis, relying on existing infrastructure and their own resources.


This is a global project based at New York University-Abu Dhabi. We have evolved into a distributed team across the world, with autonomous work groups in numerous countries, each of whom understands the PsyCorona mission goals and needs. We aim to ensure global involvement, so we are translating the survey into more languages on a daily basis.
